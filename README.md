# FFI Test Project

I'm trying to learn how to use the FFI in Rust. This project is a test project to help me learn how to use the FFI.
I'm loading a shared library libplugin01.so and monitoring if it change.
On change detect I'm reloading the library and calling the function in the library.

## Not Working

Testing manual reload every 10 seconds, but it's not working.

## Current Status

The project is currently a work in progress.
Contributions and feedback are welcome.
